## SWVl Problem 1 Inspiration
After going through all the challenges, we decided to take on the one with a huge target audience and the _italics_ main aim _italics_ of this project, for us, was to make the interface as easy as possible for the public to use even if they belong to different set of classes.

## What it does
_SWVl is basically a A technological transportation service, enabling cities, people and businesses to move everywhere._
Going with this idea we came up with ways to provide the audience with easy access of our design by making it user friendly while keeping the promise of convenience, affordability, safety and reliability.

## How we built it
Multiple procedures were used in the designing of the Prototype like low fidelity Prototypes and wireframes. For the theme selection "Color Hunt" website was used from where we tried out 6 different color themes and shortlisted one, The Final One. and finally the end product, Interactive Prototype was built in _**Figma**_.

## Challenges we ran into
Coming up with interfaces that would be easier to understand for user and introducing new features that were the actual solution to the problem statement given by the company i.e. problem of station discovery were the main challenges that we faced during our project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The main thing we achieved through this work was that the members got to improve their team working skills. There were also other things like how to auspiciously help our target audience to tackle this engaging problem.

## What we learned
A great deal of teamwork combined with time management is the the thing that we have learnt most out of this project. We were also able to improve our design skills as we had to work intently on what was to be provided to the audience for their convenience.

## What's next for elite
Well, elite is still in the early stages of development; we've created high-fidelity prototypes that will be used to develop a mobile application in the future to make elite more accessible to people who need to avail public transportation services on a daily basis within a click.
